# Oregano

The web is full of information, and sometimes, keeping tabs on everything
you might be interested in can be a challenge. Oregano has been created
in an attempt to help manage such information, and provide a way for you
to keep track of what you find interesting on the web.

## How it works

The only step is to accumulate URLs in Oregano. These URLs may point to
content on the web you like, plan to read about, or just want to
save for later. Each URL may be viewed, and if it turns out that you
find the content worthy, you may choose to pinch the URL. Now, it's not
clear yet what it actually means to pinch a URL, but hey, at least you
can.
